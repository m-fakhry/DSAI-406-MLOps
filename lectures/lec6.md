# Trick 3: Docker - Build vs Run 

:: content :: 



```docker
FROM python:3.10-slim
WORKDIR /app

# Saves the date into a file 
RUN date > /app/build_time.txt

CMD ["cat", "/app/build_time.txt"]
```

<v-click>

**Image build time**: `docker build ...`

The `RUN` date command runs once and the output is saved into `build_time.txt`, which becomes a permanent part of the image layer

</v-click>
<v-click>

**Container run time**: `docker run ...`

The `CMD` instruction is executed days later, it doesn't run the date command again. It only runs cat. It simply reads the "frozen" file from the image layer

</v-click>

# Lesson Learned

:: content :: 

1. Each Job is a separate VM. They start with an empty disk. No shared memory. No shared files

2. Each Step is a separate shell. Local variables (e.g., `VAR=1`) die when the step ends

3. 
   - Communication between Steps via `env` or local files
   - Communication between Jobs via Artifacts (for data/files)

4. 
   - `RUN`: Executed during **Image Build**
   - `CMD`: Executed at **Runtime**


<v-click>

> Global `env` blocks are **Read-Only** at runtime. You cannot update them to talk to the next Job

# Architecture Decision

:: content :: 

Scenario: Test everything but only deploy from `main`, i.e., the `Train` job  should be triggered on **all branches** but the `Deploy` job should only be triggered on the **`main` branch**.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4"> 
<v-click>
<div>

  - Single Workflow? 
  ```yaml
  on: [push]
  jobs:
    train_test: 
      ...
    deploy:
      ...
  ```
- Full visibility of the pipeline graph (DAG)
- Deploy needs Train and Test
- Shared environment and secrets

</div>
</v-click>

- Separate Workflows?

# Conditional Execution: Job Status (1)

:: content ::

When a 2-hour training job fails, you don't want to re-run it just to see the logs

<v-switch> 

<template #0>

```yaml{all}
jobs:
  train_model:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Heavy Training
        run: python train.py  # 2-hour training job fails ❌ 
```
</template>

<template #1-4>

```yaml{all|10-15}
jobs:
  train_model:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Heavy Training
        run: python train.py  # 2-hour training job fails ❌ 

      - name: Upload Training Logs on Failure
        if: failure() # Only runs if 'Heavy Training' failed
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: crash-report
          path: logs/debug_info.log

# Conditional Execution: Job Status (2)

:: content ::

Dilemma: every step is executed even if one of the previous steps fails <v-click>because of the invisible Condition `if: success()`</v-click>


<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-10"> 

<v-click>
<div>

### 🔍 What you see:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: step1
    run: ... 

  - name: step2
    run: ... 

  - name: step3
    run: ... 
```

</div>
</v-click>
<v-click>
<div>

### 🔍 What GHA actually sees:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: step1
    if: success() # (Hidden) - True
    run: ...

  - name: step2
    if: success() # Hidden 
    run: ...

  - name: step3
    if: success() 
    run: ...
```

</div>
</v-click>
</div>

<v-click>

> Every step in your YAML has a **hidden default condition**

# Conditional Execution: Job Status (3)

```yaml
steps:
  - name: compile
    run: ...

  - name: test
    run: ...

  - name: publish
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    run: ./publish.sh
```

What will happen when
- Compile and test succeed? <v-click at="1"> publish will be executed on the `main` branch </v-click> 
- Compile or test fails? <v-click at="2"> publish will also be executed on the `main` branch?! </v-click> 

<v-click at="3">

<div :style="{ zoom: $slidev.configs.zoom }">

> As soon as you write an `if:`, the default "Stop on Failure" safety is **disabled**. You must re-enable it manually.

```yaml
  - name: publish
    if: success() & github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    run: ./publish.sh
```
</div>

# Summary of Status Functions

:: content :: 

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`success()`** | (Default) Run only if no previous step/job failed |
| **`failure()`** | Run only if a previous step failed |
| **`cancelled()`** | Run only if a human clicked "Cancel" |
| **`always()`** | Run no matter what. Use for shutting down expensive GPU instances |

<br/>

**Operational Rule:**
> Never write a custom `if` condition without including `success()` or `failure()` unless you want that step to be 'Status Blind'

# Conditional Execution: Selective Training

:: content ::

```yaml
on: [push]
jobs:
  gpu_train:
    runs-on: cloud-gpu # expensive! GPU bills!!
    steps:
      - run: python train.py # what if the changes does not affect training
```

- Issue: Every tiny typo commit on every branch triggers a full GPU run. **Your budget disappears.**
