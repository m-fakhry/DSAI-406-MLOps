# TensorBoard: The Micro-Manager
### Zooming into the Training Loop

:: content :: 

While MLflow looks at the End Result, TensorBoard looks at the Process.

- **Real-time**: Watch the loss curve live. If it goes to NaN, kill the job.

- **Histograms**: View weight distributions to see if your gradients are "vanishing."

- **Embedding Projector**: Visualize high-dimensional data (like Word2Vec) in 3D.

```python 
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter

writer = SummaryWriter('logs/run_1')

for epoch in range(100):
    loss = train_step()
    # Log scalars to plot a curve
    writer.add_scalar('Loss/train', loss, epoch)
    
    # Log images to see what the model "sees"
    writer.add_image('prediction_sample', img_grid, epoch)

writer.close()
```

# Docker Compose: The Conductor
### Running your whole "Lab" at once

:: content :: 

Your ML project now has multiple moving parts:

- The Trainer (Your PyTorch code).
- The MLflow Server (To view results).
- The TensorBoard UI.

Instead of 3 terminal windows, we use Docker Compose to orchestrate them in one command.

# Git: The Source of Truth
### If it isn't in Git, it didn't happen.

:: content :: 

In MLOps, Git tracks the **Logic** (Code, Dockerfiles, Configs), but **never** the heavy lifting.

* ✅ **Track these:** `.py` scripts, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, `.github/workflows/`.
* ❌ **Ignore these:** `.pkl` models, `.csv` data, `venv/` folders, `.log` files.

      <b>The Rule:</b> If a file is >50MB or changes every time you run a script (like a log), it belongs in <b>DVC</b> or an <b>Artifact Store</b>, not Git.

# Git Flow for ML Teams
### Collaboration without the "Merge Chaos"

Undergraduates often work on `main`. In MLOps, we use **Feature Branches** to experiment.

1. **`main`**: The "Production" code. It must always be runnable.
2. **`feature/add-random-forest`**: Where you experiment with new models.
3. **The Pull Request (PR)**: Where MLOps magic happens. 
   - *In 2 weeks, we will make GitHub automatically run tests on every PR.*

### 💡 The "Model-Code" Link
Every commit hash in Git (e.g., `a7b2c3d`) should represent a specific state of your project. If you deploy a model, you must be able to say: 
> "This model was built from **Git Commit a7b2c3d** using **DVC Data Version v2**."
